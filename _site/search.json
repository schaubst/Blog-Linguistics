Language data can be very tricky to work with, not just for linguists, but also for people in data science or other disciplines with little or no linguistic background knowledge. R has some great packages that makes it easy to do everything that a linguist does. With this blog, I want to bridge linguistics and data science through the magic of R.\r\nI’m an R learner, so please don’t expect my code to be elegant. Definitely do not expect it to be the only solution to a problem. I post about the kinds of problems that I need to solve for my work or research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
